Description:
Designed and developed an advanced news research tool using a custom Gemini LLM for natural language processing, Hugging Face embeddings for semantic search, and Streamlit for the user interface. Integrated the Langchain framework for building a Retrieval-based Q&A system with FAISS as a vector store. The system processes news articles from URLs, splits the text into chunks for efficient retrieval, and generates accurate responses with source references using Gemini.
